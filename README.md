Name of Workflow:  GitFlow

Description of Basic Git workflow: In basic git workflow, there is a master repository and each person makes individual forks where they can make edits to a cloned version of the master. Each developer then sends in pull requests to the build master to merge the edits/new features on their cloned repository with the master repository.

Description of __Git Flow__ workflow: In the Git Flow model, developers utilize branch repositories to organize their work. As in all types of Git workflows, there is a master repository that always contains the working code of the last update. In Git Flow, there’s also the development branch where editors can try out new features. Developers can make commits and pull requests to the branch repository until they’re satisfied that it is a new, updated, working model. Once that’s done, the build master can then merge the whole branch repository into the master repository all at once.

Key Differences from basic workflow, and key use cases: In git flow design, there is a branch repository that’s sole purpose is to act as an update stream that can be edited by developers to highlight a specific type of update the project is focused around. In the basic git workflow, the editing process is more individualized and open because the contributors can work on the minor details of the master branch more easily. Overall, the gitflow branching method is useful when dealing with large and regular updates to a working software. The basic git workflow is useful for maintenance of a large working system.

Hey it's Lohit again. So it turnsout GIT automatically pushes to master. I need to checkout to the development branch. So yeah that's that. Here's a dev push that may not be ready for the amster branch yet.
