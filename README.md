# Gitflow-Example-Repo
Hey it's Lohit again. So it turnsout GIT automatically pushes to master. I need to checkout to the development branch. So yeah that's that. Here's a dev push that may not be ready for the amster branch yet.




My name is Lohit Geddam. I am in the 3rd period AP CSA class. I am sad because I forgot to push my cooler animation to git. I couldn't open this file on my mac so I had to use vim then spam buttons untill i figured out how to type. It's "I " for insert. Well yeah that's it.
